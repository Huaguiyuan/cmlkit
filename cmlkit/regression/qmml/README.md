# `qmmlpack` KRR

This provides a `cmlkit` interface to `qmmlpack`'s implementation of KRR.

... and there's little to say beyond that? The `krr.py` module should be your starting point.

Please note that [`qmmlpack`](https://gitlab.com/qmml/qmmlpack/-/tree/development) needs to be installed in order for this module to work. (On the develoment branch!)
